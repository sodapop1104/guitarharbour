      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        Guitar Harbour was founded in the Philippines in 2014 by <b>Bimbo Canayon</b>, under the mentorship of master
        luthier <b>Max Rufo</b>. What began as a humble repair bench soon grew into a trusted workshop known for
        precision, reliability, and a deep respect for the craft.
      </p>

      <p>
        By 2016, Guitar Harbour began building custom guitars, a natural evolution of its repair and modification
        expertise. Around 2020, shortly after the pandemic, we introduced our first Custom Line Series with the
        <b> Alon</b> and <b> Ulap</b> models—crafted to embody both artistry and playability. Today, we are preparing to
        launch our next generation of custom builds: the <b>Alpha</b>, <b>Genesis</b>, and <b>Exodus</b> series.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, Guitar Harbour also grew into a dedicated team. Now, the shop in the Philippines is represented
        by <b>Way</b>, <b>Jr</b>, and <b>Marc</b>—highly credible and well-trained craftsmen who embody the shop’s values
        of quality, integrity, and service.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2025, Guitar Harbour opened a new chapter in Los Angeles, California, bringing the same dedication to
        craftsmanship and service to the Los Angeles music scene.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, Guitar Harbour Custom Shop continues its mission: to repair, refine, and reimagine guitars so musicians
        can fully express their sound.
