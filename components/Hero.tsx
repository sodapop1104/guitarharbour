          Setups, Fret Levels &amp; Electronics — Dialed In.
        </h1>

        <p className="reveal" data-anim="up">
          Every guitar should feel inspiring in your hands — whether it’s a weekend practice session, a recording
          take, or a live gig. That’s the philosophy behind every service we offer: bringing out the best feel,
          sound, and reliability in your instrument so you can focus entirely on playing.
        </p>

        <p className="reveal" data-anim="up">
          We start with the essentials. A full setup means more than just a few adjustments — it’s a complete reset
          for your guitar. The instrument is cleaned, conditioned, and inspected piece by piece to ensure every detail
          is balanced. Action and intonation are dialed in to your preference, nut height is corrected for smooth
          tuning and comfortable chords, and pickup balance is fine-tuned so every note rings clear and even.
        </p>

        <p className="reveal" data-anim="up">
          For players chasing peak performance, we take things further. Fret leveling, crowning, and polishing remove
          subtle imperfections that hold your playing back, unlocking lower action, cleaner bends, and better sustain.
          If your frets are worn beyond repair, we can perform a full refret using premium Jescar wire — restoring
          your neck to a like-new feel while giving you a fresh foundation built for years of play.
        </p>

          Looking for something more custom? We craft precision-cut nuts, install acoustic preamps, and perform crack
          repairs to keep your instrument roadworthy. From routine maintenance to specialized upgrades, every job is
          handled with professional-grade tools, quality materials, and the goal of unlocking your guitar’s full
          potential.
